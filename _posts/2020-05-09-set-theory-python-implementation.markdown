This week I spent some time to implement set theory  using Python. As [COVID-19](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus_disease_2019) is doing the rounds, chose the COVID-19 test kit clinical trials as a use-case.

I used [Venn diagrams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venn_diagram to illustrate the realtionship between the sets. Execute following command to install `matplotlib-venn` library.
```
pip3 install matplotlib-venn 
``` 
Download the [IPYNB](https://gist.github.com/pranavek/ef7afca6b4896bca753e7a39f8b444c9) file to your system. In your terminal change directory to the location where the file was downloaded to and run the Juptyer notebook by exectuing following command.
```
jupyter notebook
```
