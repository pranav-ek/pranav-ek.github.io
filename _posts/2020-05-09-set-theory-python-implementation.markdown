title: A Python Implementation of Set Theory

This week I spent some time to implement set theory fundamentals using Python. As [COVID-19](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus_disease_2019) is doing the rounds, chose the COVID-19 test kit clinical trials as a use-case. 

A Jupyter notebook file has been embedded into this article. I used some [Venn diagrams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venn_diagram) to illustrate the realtionship between the sets. We need to install a Python library to visualize the sets as Venn diagrams; execute following command to install `matplotlib-venn` library.
```
pip3 install matplotlib matplotlib-venn 
``` 
Download the [IPYNB file](https://gist.github.com/pranavek/ef7afca6b4896bca753e7a39f8b444c9) to your system. In your terminal, change directory to the location where the file was downloaded to and run the [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) notebook by executing following command.
```
jupyter notebook

```

If you are using [Jupyter lab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
```
jupyter lab
```
